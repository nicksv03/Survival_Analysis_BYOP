# Survival Analysis On Synthesis Data for Diabetic Patients

Thanks to everyone in the group for their contribution and support - Ashutosh, Babli, Orooj, Swapnil, Shubhi and Suruchi.

### Project Details

This is the BYOP (bring your own project) Capstone Project for our IPBA Program from IIM Indore.

Our project is built on the foundation of research and collaboration.
- Through survival analysis we can help business estimate customer lifetime value, the same can be leveraged to forecast patient time on therapy.
- There were 4 main challenges in front of the team:
- Data procurement, Self study of survival analysis technique, Business logic implementation, Create simulation
structure to provide answer to business in different scenarios
- The team was successfully able to overcome these challenges and create a working model to answer the above questions.
- The existing solution has 2 parts, the first part is the simulation to generate data depending on different situations and the second is survival model; both of these can be used together or independently.
- We recommend use of the existing solution as a support structure in decision making coupled with real world data, the other major use will be to replicate the patterns of the real world data to the existing simulation (modification required) and see the affects on patient time on therapy.

### Objective

Main objective for this project is to provide a solution that busineses can implement to understand the patient's behaviour and different scenarios. Healthcare business long term profitability depends on patient retention or time on therapy. We aimed to create a working model for analysis that can help us estimate the patient time on therapy.

### Data

We have generated the simulated Anonymised Patient Level Data using the python Faker module.
